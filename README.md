## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
#Answer:-
1. Fundamental Concepts of Version Control:

Version Control: Tracks changes to files, allowing multiple collaborators without overwriting work, and maintains a history of changes.

Repository (Repo): Storage space for project files and their revision history.

Commit: Record of changes made to files in the repository with a unique identifier and a message.

Branch: Separate line of development for new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase.

Merge: Combines changes from different branches into a single branch, resolving conflicts if necessary.

Clone: Creates a copy of a repository on your local machine for offline work.

Push/Pull: Push sends changes to a remote repository, and pull fetches changes from a remote repository.

Why GitHub is Popular for Version Control:

Collaboration: Easy collaboration on projects, sharing code, and contributing to open-source projects.

Code Review: Supports code reviews for team members to discuss changes before merging.

Issue Tracking: Built-in system for tracking bugs, feature requests, and tasks.
